# ValkyrieDB #

## About ##

ValkyrieDB is a ridiculously simple read-only key/value database designed to be fed from Hadoop/HDFS. It is modeled on [ElephantDB](https://github.com/nathanmarz/elephantdb "ElephantDB").

We current use Thrift to provide a network interface and [Krati](http://sna-projects.com/krati/ "Krati") for local persistence.
